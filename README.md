# manning_random_forest_classifier_liveproject
Starter repo for the random forest loan default classification Manning liveProject.

This project uses [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) Python distribution.  Download and install anaconda, then install the environment for this project with:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Then activate the environment with `conda activate manning_classification`.

The loan_data.csv file is the data file you should use to start the project.  The Data Dictionary.xlsx file has definitions for each data column.


## Data

The data to use for the first 3 milestones is loan_data.csv.  For milestone 4, we use new_loan_data.csv to see how our trained random forest compares with the hand-coded method.  The data comes from a hackathon and is posted on Kaggle.com.  However, the data included here has been slightly modified.  See the link to the data source in milestone 4 for the original datasets.
