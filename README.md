# manning_random_forest_classifier_liveproject
Starter repo for the random forest loan default classification Manning liveProject.

This project uses [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) Python distribution.  Download and install anaconda, then install the environment for this project with:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Then activate the environment with `conda activate manning_rf`.

# Data and files
The `loan_data.csv` file is the data file you should use to start the project.  The `Data Dictionary.xlsx` file has definitions for each data column.  `new_loan_data.csv` will be used in milestone 4 to evaluate performance vs the hard-coded method, and hard\_coded\_method.py is the module which contains code to get predictions on loan defaults using the hard-coded rules.  The data comes from a hackathon and is posted on Kaggle.com.  However, the data included here has been slightly modified.  See the link to the data source in milestone 4 for the original datasets, and the Jupyter Notebook in the milestone 4 solutions to see how the data was preprocessed.
